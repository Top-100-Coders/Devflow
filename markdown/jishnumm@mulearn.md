#### My Contribution:

My name is Jishnu M M, an ardent developer of Team Reverend. Eventhough, I am a beginner in fullstack development, and an intermediate python developer, I tried to make one of the most useful tools that can be used as a Visual Studio Code extension.

- The central objective of this extension is to revolutionize file management within Visual Studio Code by providing users with a prompt-friendly interface. The goal is to simplify and expedite common file-related tasks, enabling users to create, edit, and organize files through natural language prompts. This approach aims to enhance the overall coding experience by reducing manual effort and making file management more accessible.
- OpenAI Audio Transcription Integration - As an additional feature to the core objective of this extension is to seamlessly integrate OpenAI's powerful audio transcription capabilities into Visual Studio Code, enabling users to transcribe spoken words into text effortlessly. The goal is to break down barriers in communication by allowing developers to interact with their codebase through voice commands, enhancing accessibility and fostering a more dynamic coding experience.


#### Key Contributions:

- Implemented file management within Visual Studio Code providing users with a prompt-friendly interface.
- Implemented OpenAI's powerful audio transcription of whisper and openai davinci capabilities into Visual Studio Code extension.

#### Challenges Overcome

- Getting voice input in typescript node.js environment was really tough and is really hard to implement. So I tried to do it it in webview but since all other features which we made was needed to be merged into one it will take some time. Thats why I implemented it without webview.

#### Future Enhancements

- Looking ahead, I plan to implement realtime voice speech to text in visual code extension. (#jarvis vscode extension)
- Also, I want to make the whole extension in webview and with a sidebar facility.
- When getting error in terminal and our extension reads that error and apply the solution on its own.
- In the next phase, we are planning to integrate a new protocol to the system where developers can simply type the instruct the system

#### Final Thoughts

- For a beginner who doesn't know how to run linux commands, do git commands, and read documentation and copy package installation codes, our extension is a boon to them.
